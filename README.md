# NLP
This is the directory for Natural Language Processing.  
The content is devided mainly as  
  
(1)DeepLearning with supervised/unsupervised learning, such as sequence-to-sequence model or basic use of RNN ,   
in order to make new sentences automatically.  
  
(2)Class labeling of input sentences.   
That is, by using the methods such as tfidf, extract some key feature words in each chapter in a textbook.   
Based on the words and scores, in each input (this is a past exam question),  predict the chapter in the textbook which is the most relevant to the input.

(3)ccg2lambda

This is the attempt to get a meaning of a sentence, using semantic templates and given CCG syntax trees.
You can see the details from the links below.
